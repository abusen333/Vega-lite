This repository contains visual templates developed using Vega-Lite in Deneb, a Power BI visual that enables the use of Vega-Lite programming in Power BI. Vega-Lite is a high-level visualization grammar that allows users to create rich and interactive visualizations with a concise and intuitive syntax. You can learn more about Vega-Lite and its capabilities on their website: https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/. Deneb builds on this grammar by providing a custom visual for Power BI that allows users to create Vega-Lite visualizations directly within the Power BI interface. You can learn more about Deneb and download it from the Microsoft AppSource: https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/coacervolimited1596856650797.deneb?exp=ubp8&tab=Overview. The templates in this repository can be used as a starting point for creating custom visualizations using Vega-Lite in Deneb. With the ability to create rich and interactive visualizations, these templates can help users better understand and communicate their data in Power BI.
